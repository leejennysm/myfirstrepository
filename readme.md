## Hello World. This is my first repository!

My name is Jenny, and I'm a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley. I've never really coded before, but this seems really exciting and fun so far!

If I did this correctly, I should have made a link to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/).

Here is a map of hate crimes that have been committed in the United States from 1991 to 2018.
![Map of hate crimes in the United States from 1991 to 2018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTvZaGwuLWeh4SPe3RveZV82RXplkPcFtT7-qliLs_pxrdxvz4xIs32wej7oeozJ6kSglM82sw0IR21/pubchart?oid=469803788&format=image)

Please note, for journalistic and statistical purposes, comparing hate crimes between states, especially over a large period of time, is not recommended because there are too many confounding factors. For example, the population may vary every year, the mode for collecting data may change and/or the officials who are responsible for reporting hate crimes have different criteria for what constitutes a hate crime.

Things I like to do in Berkeley:

* Visit the Botanical Garden — with my mask on, of course!
* Read The Daily Californian
* Challenge myself academically and push myself to be the best student I can be

My plans for the weekend are:

1. Complete all of the assignments for Professor Rue's class
2. Go on a walk with my mother and dog
3. Play the piano — I stopped playing over a year ago because I had to leave for college, but I've slowly been getting back into it during quarantine
