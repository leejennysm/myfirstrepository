Things I like to do in Berkeley:

* Stay safe during quarantine
* Cook tasty meals
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

My plans for the weekend are:
1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class
2. Double-check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments
3. Triple-check that all assignments are done.
